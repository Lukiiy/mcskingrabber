# MCSkinGrabber

## Test this repo [here](https://lukiiy.github.io/mcskingrabber/)

A simple minecraft (java edition) skin grabber with JS (and cape) using Electroid's Mojang API.  
**The API can be found [here](https://github.com/Electroid/mojang-api)!**  
  
Also sorry for the bad code, I was in a hurry while coding it for my website.
